# cadius

BrutalDeluxe's Cadius disk imaging utility, with some maintenance and *nix support.

## Getting Started

It is recommended that you begin by [reading the official documentation](http://brutaldeluxe.fr/products/crossdevtools/cadius/index.html). Prebuilt binaries coming soon, but for now you must build from source.

View the contents of an image by using the `CATALOG` command:

```bash
cadius CATALOG ~/path/to/image.po | less
```

## Building

This tutorial covers building for most *nix flavors, or on Windows with Cygwin. Windows instructions coming soon, but you should be able to add all of the files to a new MSVC project and build it.

Ensure your system has `gcc` or `clang` and associated build tools, then clone the repository, and build it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mach-kernel/cadius.git
cd cadius
# GCC is default, but override with CC=clang for clang or your preferred compiler
make
./bin/release/cadius
```

## Contributions

Any and all contributions are welcome. Included is also a `cadius.pro` file you can use with [Qt Creator](http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/) if you want an IDE with a nice GDB frontend. Be mindful of the following:

- Preserve the existing code style, especially with pointer declarations.
- As you explore the codebase, consider writing a Doxygen docstring for functions you come across / find important.
- Try to test on OS X and Linux if including new headers.
- In your PR, please add a changelog entry.
